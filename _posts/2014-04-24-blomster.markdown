Optimization class wasn't working for me... I was bored, but the idea of working on genetic algorithms was appealing. To teach myself the concepts, I created a Processing sketch that I called Blomster (Norwegian for flower).

When you launch the sketch, a target flower is chosen and then an algorithm breeds generations of flowers to optimize towards the target. Once the convergence threshold is crossed, generational best flowers are displayed on a grid, with the target in the middle.

Note that there are a number of variables you can set in the `blomster.pde` file. Eventually, I had several prints made from output from this sketch. It was a lot of fun to build!
