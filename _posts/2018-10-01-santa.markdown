During a hack day at work, I made a simple procedurally generated Santa present-delivery game. More than anything, the project was a chance for me to learn the [Godot][godot] game engine and to discover a workflow for drawing game assets on an iPad. I settled on using [Affinity Designer][affinity] after struggling a bit with [Autodesk Sketchbook][sketchbook]. The ability to combine vector and raster graphics in a single document and to save to iCloud for export and editing on my Mac is what eventually sold me on Affinity Designer.

You can download and play it for free on [itch.io](https://clay.itch.io/santa-overslept).
