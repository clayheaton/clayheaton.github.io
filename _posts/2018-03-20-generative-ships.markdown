I was invited to give a lecture at North Carolina State University on procedural generation of content in games. Among other things, I wanted to discuss systems and constraints and thought it would be fun to build a little Processing sketch that would allow students to explore some constraint systems.

Meanwhile, I had been nerding out on Rob Turpin's hand-drawn spaceships, as seen here. [Check out his Twitter for more](https://twitter.com/thisnorthernboy).

The Processing sketch I created loosely follows his design grammar. Frankly, had I decided upon the idea more than a few hours before the lecture, I would have spent more time trying to mimic some of the elements he includes in his work. Nevertheless, the result was a tool that served the purpose of the lecture. You can download it [from this Github repository](https://github.com/clayheaton/generative_ships) if you'd like to play with it yourself. 

Here are a few screens of it.
